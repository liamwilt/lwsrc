Documenting the creation and maintenance of a website.

http://liamwilt.com/

Admittedly, the primary use of Git software is in version control. In this instance however, it may better serve (me) as an historical account, offering a measure of transparency into my learning and development. Here you will find contributions of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each logged as a commit to this repository. Each commit also represents a near one-to-one reflection of the alterations made directly to the above-listed website. Feel free to review all available files.

If you wish to review any additional excursions into website development, please visit my [CodePen account](http://codepen.io/liamwilt/).
