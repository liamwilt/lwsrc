Documenting the creation, maintenance, and closure of a website:

Admittedly, the primary use of Git software is in version control. Here however, it better served (me) as an historical account, offering a window into my learning and development. Each commit represented a near one-to-one reflection of the changes made directly to the linked site prior to its removal. Feel free to review all available files.

If you wish to review any additional web creations, please visit my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/wi11iamk).
